<h1>Alan Jackson</h1>,<h2> (born October 17, 1958, Newnan, Georgia, U.S.), American country music singer-songwriter who was one of the most popular male country artists of the 1990s and early 21st century.
Jackson grew up in rural Georgia singing gospel music and performing, as a teenager, in a country duo. After dropping out of school and wedding his high-school sweetheart, Denise, Jackson worked odd jobs while playing with his band, Dixie Steel. After Denise, a flight attendant, happened upon country artist Glen Campbell in an airport in 1985, Jackson’s demo tape landed him a songwriting contract with Campbell’s music-publishing company. The couple subsequently moved to Nashville.

In 1989 Jackson became the first artist signed to the country division of Arista Records, and he released his debut album, Here in the Real World, that same year. Its hit title track, cowritten by Jackson with Mark Irwin, established the singer as a composer of songs that speak directly about the virtues of rural and small-town life, the vagaries of love, and the value of the country music traditions inherited from predecessors such as George Jones and Hank Williams. Jackson experienced further success with such honky-tonk-inspired albums as Don’t Rock the Jukebox (1991); A Lot About Livin’ (And a Little ’Bout Love) (1992), which featured the hit single “Chattahoochee”; and Who I Am (1994).
